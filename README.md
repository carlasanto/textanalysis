# textanalysis
I made the analysis of a forum to see which were the words that were repeated the most.
We take the category of a forum that we want to analyze and we start by cleaning the text of words that have to do with the code of the same.
then we add the words to ban, in this example they can be forum, forum, etc.
Then we get the numbers and the monosyllables.
We go on to detect the most repeated words, we put it in a file and we show the graph of the analysis.
I used the libraries BeautifulSoup, matplotlib.
